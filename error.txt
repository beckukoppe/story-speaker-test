Speak with hostage taker (end with 'exit'):

User: hello, are you there? Here is Inspektor Koppe, the police negotiator
Hostage taker says:
Yes, I'm here. I have your attention now. What do you want?
User: What i want? I think that this situation is about what you want. You took the hostages.
Hostage taker says:
Yes, I did. And I want $5 million and a getaway vehicle. I want it delivered here within the next hour. I'm not playing games here. I have hostages, and I'm not afraid to use them as leverage.
User: Okay. How many do you want?
Hostage taker says:
I want 5 hostages released. I want them to be the ones who have nothing to do with the bank's operations. No managers, no security guards. Just regular people. And I want them out in the next 30 minutes. And I want the money and the car to be ready in 1 hour. If not, I start killing hostages. #FREE(5)
User: oh, you freed 5 hostages? thats good to hear. how many remain?
Hostage taker says:
There are 10 hostages remaining. Now, let's get back to business. I want that money and that car. And I want it now. Time is ticking. Don't make me wait.
User: okay. then release the other 10 and you get the car and the money
Hostage taker says:
No deals. I want the money and the car. I am not releasing anyone else. You have 30 minutes.
User: okay. i will go and organize
